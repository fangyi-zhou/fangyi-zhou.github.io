In this April Fool&amp;rsquo;s paper, we explore a possible logic that encapsulates seemingly contradictory observations in the real life. We investigate how such contradictions can be represented in a logic, and show its decidability. Moreover, we prove standard theorems such as &amp;ldquo;Law of Excluded Middle&amp;rdquo;, but also novel theorems such as &amp;ldquo;Law of Contradiction&amp;rdquo;.</description></item><item><title>Meta-Programming in LaTeX</title><link>https://fangyi.io/2022/03/meta-programming-in-latex/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fangyi.io/2022/03/meta-programming-in-latex/</guid><description>Many researchers write paper in $\LaTeX$ because it provides a convenient macro system that makes typesetting maths equations easy (or difficult, when it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work).
One way to write papers in $\LaTeX$ is to use as few &amp;ldquo;advanced features&amp;rdquo; as possible, for a vanilla experience: no fancy packages, just use the minimal setup. Gradually, as the paper starts to grow long, you begin to think of adding some macros for things that are too long to type, for example:</description></item><item><title>Statically Verified Refinements for Multiparty Protocols @ OOPSLA '20</title><link>https://fangyi.io/2020/03/statically-verified-refinements-for-multiparty-protocols-oopsla-20/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fangyi.io/2020/03/statically-verified-refinements-for-multiparty-protocols-oopsla-20/</guid><description>I presented my paper Statically Verified Refinements for Multiparty Protocols at OOPSLA 2020 this year, held virtually.
