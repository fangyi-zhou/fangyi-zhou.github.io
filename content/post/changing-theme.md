title: Changing the theme of the blog
date: 2026-02-07

I wanted to write something in the blog again.
Unfortunately, the website no longer builds with my original theme.
After spending some time to debug and fix the theme, I decided to give up and
asked Claude to migrate my blog to a new theme.

Fortunate enough, the advancement of AI technology means that I can watch my
blog changing theme automagically from a distance; and now my blog has a new
theme and I can write about stuff again.

Stay tuned for some updates!
