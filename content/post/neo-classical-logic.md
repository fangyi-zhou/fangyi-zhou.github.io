My colleague Martin Vassor and I worked on a paper with title
_Neo-Classical Logic_ for [SIGBOVIK](http://sigbovik.org/) 2022[^1].
[^1]: If you don't know what is SIGBOVIK, I would strongly recommend you to
  check it out.

You can read the paper [here](/assets/papers/neoclassical-logic.pdf) (with reviews).

In this ~~April Fool's~~ paper, we explore a possible logic that encapsulates
seemingly contradictory observations in the real life.
We investigate how such contradictions can be represented in a logic, and show
its decidability.
Moreover, we prove standard theorems such as "Law of Excluded Middle", but also
novel theorems such as "Law of Contradiction".

If you wish to submit a review, please send it to my email address[^2]. I will
incorporate them in an updated version.
