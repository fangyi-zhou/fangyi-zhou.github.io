title: Fluid Session Types @ PLACES

I gave a talk on the ongoing work of Fluid Session Types last Sunday in PLACES,
Prague. This is joint work with my supervisors, Francisco Ferreira, Rumyana
Neykova and Nobuko Yoshida.

The slides are [here](/assets/slides/PLACES2019.pdf).

If you feel curious, [here](https://github.com/fangyi-zhou/FluidTypes) is the
repo to the ongoing work. It's still in an embryonic state, but feel free to
try out!
