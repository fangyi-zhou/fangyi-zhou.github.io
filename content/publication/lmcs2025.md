Session types provide a typing discipline for message-passing systems. However,
their theory often assumes an ideal world: one in which everything is reliable
and without failures. Yet this is in stark contrast with distributed systems in
the real world. To address this limitation, we introduce a new asynchronous
multiparty session types (MPST) theory with crash-stop failures, where
processes may crash arbitrarily and cease to interact after crashing. We
augment asynchronous MPST and processes with crash handling branches, and
integrate crash-stop failure semantics into types and processes. Our approach
requires no user-level syntax extensions for global types, and features a
formalisation of global semantics, which captures complex behaviours induced by
crashed/crash handling processes. Our new theory covers the entire spectrum,
ranging from the ideal world of total reliability to entirely unreliable
scenarios where any process may crash, using optional reliability assumptions.
Under these assumptions, we demonstrate the sound and complete correspondence
between global and local type semantics, which guarantee deadlock-freedom,
protocol conformance, and liveness of well-typed processes by construction,
even in the presence of crashes.
