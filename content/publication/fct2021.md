Multiparty session types (MPST) provide a typing discipline for message passing
concurrency, ensuring deadlock freedom for distributed processes. This paper
first summarises the relationship between MPST and communicating finite state
machines (CFSMs), which offers not only theoretical justifications of MPST but
also a guidance to implement MPST in practice. As one of the applications, we
present ùúàSCR  (NuScr), an extensible toolchain for MPST-based multiparty
protocols. The toolchain can convert multiparty protocols in the Scribble
protocol description language into global types in the MPST theory; global
types are projected into local types, and local types are converted to their
corresponding CFSMs. The toolchain also generates APIs from CFSMs that
implement endpoints in the protocol. Our design allows for language-independent
code generation, and opens possibilities to generate APIs in various
programming languages. We design our toolchain with modularity and
extensibility in mind, so that extensions of core MPST can be easily integrated
within our framework. As a case study, we show the implementation of the nested
protocol extension in ùúàSCR , to showcase our extensibility.
