However,
their theory often assumes an ideal world: one in which everything is reliable
and without failures. Yet this is in stark contrast with distributed systems in
the real world. To address this limitation, we introduce a new asynchronous
multiparty session types (MPST) theory with crash-stop failures, where
processes may crash arbitrarily and cease to interact after crashing. We
augment asynchronous MPST and processes with crash handling branches, and
integrate crash-stop failure semantics into types and processes. Our approach
requires no user-level syntax extensions for global types, and features a
formalisation of global semantics, which captures complex behaviours induced by
crashed/crash handling processes. Our new theory covers the entire spectrum,
ranging from the ideal world of total reliability to entirely unreliable
scenarios where any process may crash, using optional reliability assumptions.
Under these assumptions, we demonstrate the sound and complete correspondence
between global and local type semantics, which guarantee deadlock-freedom,
protocol conformance, and liveness of well-typed processes by construction,
even in the presence of crashes.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Designing Asynchronous Multiparty Protocols with Crash-Stop Failures</title><link>https://fangyi.io/publication/2023/designing-asynchronous-multiparty-protocols-with-crash-stop-failures/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fangyi.io/publication/2023/designing-asynchronous-multiparty-protocols-with-crash-stop-failures/</guid><description>&lt;p>Session types provide a typing discipline for message-passing systems.

systems. However, their theory often assumes that processes never fail. To
address this limitation, we present a generalised multiparty session type
(MPST) theory with crash-stop failures, where processes can crash arbitrarily.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our new theory validates more protocols and processes w.r.t. previous work. We
apply minimal syntactic changes to standard session $\pi$-calculus and types:
we model crashes and their handling semantically, with a generalised MPST
typing system parametric on a behavioural safety property. We cover the
spectrum between fully reliable and fully unreliable sessions, via optional
reliability assumptions, and prove type safety and protocol conformance in the
presence of crash-stop failures.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Communicating Finite State Machines and an Extensible Toolchain for Multiparty Session Types</title><link>https://fangyi.io/publication/2021/communicating-finite-state-machines-and-an-extensible-toolchain-for-multiparty-session-types/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fangyi.io/publication/2021/communicating-finite-state-machines-and-an-extensible-toolchain-for-multiparty-session-types/</guid><description>&lt;p>Multiparty session types (MPST) provide a typing discipline for message passing
concurrency, ensuring deadlock freedom for distributed processes. This paper
first summarises the relationship between MPST and communicating finite state
machines (CFSMs), which offers not only theoretical justifications of MPST but
also a guidance to implement MPST in practice. As one of the applications, we
present 𝜈SCR (NuScr), an extensible toolchain for MPST-based multiparty
protocols. The toolchain can convert multiparty protocols in the Scribble
protocol description language into global types in the MPST theory; global
types are projected into local types, and local types are converted to their
corresponding CFSMs. The toolchain also generates APIs from CFSMs that
implement endpoints in the protocol. Our design allows for language-independent
code generation, and opens possibilities to generate APIs in various
programming languages. We design our toolchain with modularity and
extensibility in mind, so that extensions of core MPST can be easily integrated
within our framework. As a case study, we show the implementation of the nested
protocol extension in 𝜈SCR , to showcase our extensibility.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Communication-Safe Web Programming in TypeScript with Routed Multiparty Session Types</title><link>https://fangyi.io/publication/2021/communication-safe-web-programming-in-typescript-with-routed-multiparty-session-types/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fangyi.io/publication/2021/communication-safe-web-programming-in-typescript-with-routed-multiparty-session-types/</guid><description>&lt;p>Modern web programming involves coordinating interactions between browser
clients and a server. Typically, the interactions in web-based distributed
systems are informally described, making it hard to ensure correctness,
especially communication safety, i.e. all endpoints progress without type
errors or deadlocks, conforming to a specified protocol.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We present STScript, a toolchain that generates TypeScript APIs for
communication-safe web development over WebSockets, and RouST, a new session
type theory that supports multiparty communications with routing mechanisms.
STScript provides developers with TypeScript APIs generated from a
communication protocol specification based on RouST. The generated APIs build
upon TypeScript concurrency practices, complement the event-driven style of
programming in full-stack web development, and are compatible with the Node.js
runtime for server-side endpoints and the React.js framework for browser-side
endpoints.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Statically Verified Refinements for Multiparty Protocols</title><link>https://fangyi.io/publication/2020/statically-verified-refinements-for-multiparty-protocols/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fangyi.io/publication/2020/statically-verified-refinements-for-multiparty-protocols/</guid><description>&lt;p>With distributed computing becoming ubiquitous in the modern era, safe
distributed programming is an open challenge. To address this, multiparty
session types (MPST) provide a typing discipline for message-passing
concurrency, guaranteeing communication safety properties such as deadlock
freedom.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While originally MPST focus on the communication aspects, and employ a simple
typing system for communication payloads, communication protocols in the real
world usually contain constraints on the payload. We introduce refined
multiparty session types (RMPST), an extension of MPST, that express data
dependent protocols via refinement types on the data types.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Generating Interactive WebSocket Applications in TypeScript</title><link>https://fangyi.io/publication/2020/generating-interactive-websocket-applications-in-typescript/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fangyi.io/publication/2020/generating-interactive-websocket-applications-in-typescript/</guid><description>&lt;p>Advancements in mobile device computing power have made interactive web
applications possible, allowing the web browser to render contents dynamically
and support low-latency communication with the server. This comes at a cost to
the developer, who now needs to reason more about correctness of communication
patterns in their application as web applications support more complex
communication patterns.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Multiparty session types (MPST) provide a framework for verifying conformance
of implementations to their prescribed communication protocol. Existing
proposals for applying the MPST framework in application developments either
neglect the event-driven nature of web applications, or lack compatibility with
industry tools and practices, which discourages mainstream adoption by web
developers.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
