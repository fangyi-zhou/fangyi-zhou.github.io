<meta name=description content="Session types enable the specification and verification of communicating

address this limitation, we present a generalised multiparty session type
(MPST) theory with crash-stop failures, where processes can crash arbitrarily.
Our new theory validates more protocols and processes w.r.t. previous work. We
apply minimal syntactic changes to standard session $\pi$-calculus and types:
we model crashes and their handling semantically, with a generalised MPST
typing system parametric on a behavioural safety property. We cover the
spectrum between fully reliable and fully unreliable sessions, via optional
reliability assumptions, and prove type safety and protocol conformance in the
presence of crash-stop failures."><meta property="og:image" content="https://fangyi.io/"><meta property="og:url" content="https://fangyi.io/publication/2022/generalised-multiparty-session-types-with-crash-stop-failures/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Fangyi Zhou"><meta property="og:title" content="Generalised Multiparty Session Types with Crash-Stop Failures"><meta property="og:description" content="Session types enable the specification and verification of communicating systems.

processes that handle all crash scenarios can be difficult. Yet, our
generalised MPST theory allows us to tame this complexity, via model checking,
to validate whether a multiparty session satisfies desired behavioural
properties, e.g. deadlock-freedom or liveness, even in presence of crashes. We
implement our approach using the mCRL2 model checker, and evaluate it with
examples extended from the literature.</p></section></article></main><footer><div style=display:flex><a class=soc href=https://github.com/fangyi-zhou rel=me title=GitHub><svg class="feather"><use href="/svg/feather-sprite.51cf5647cb1987f769b616558f2620fd9423d72058490231b391bf6aa3744b55.svg#github"/></svg></a><a class=border></a></div><div class=footer-info>2026 Fangyi Zhou © CC BY 4.0 | <a href=https://github.com/athul/archie>Archie Theme</a> | Built with <a href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo</a></div></footer></div></body></html>
